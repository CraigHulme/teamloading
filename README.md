# teamloading // Cinematic Intro (v.01)
For anyone who wants to learn how Cinematic Intro came about; this is very old, may not work and also has no where near the capability of Cinematic Intro. However if you cannot afford Cinematic Intro then try this out!

# usage

## how do I make use of this?

simple really, fill out the config and now you can call the function(s) provided in the file on the client at any point to initiate it.
you can also end it at any point.

## dev hooks

there are none, the full addon at 
https://www.gmodstore.com/scripts/view/2838/cinematic-intro
has a lot more features, plus its a lot more secure.
heres  a few:

•Very customizable
•Anti Abuse (Hide specific entities)
•MAP SUPPORT
•Music Support (YouTube)
•Multiple Angles (Get the good cinematic shots!)

and a lot more easier to setup with more advanced methods. It also includes dev hooks such as when a player starts the intro or ends it - or even if they clicked the skip button. all great for expanding upon the initial addon itself.
